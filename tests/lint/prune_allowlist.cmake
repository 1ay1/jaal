# prune_allowlist.cmake — report allowlist entries that no longer earn their
# keep, using the BANLIST'S OWN matching rules so the answer can't disagree
# with the check it feeds.
#
# Lives next to banlist.cmake because all three trees in the chain (jaal,
# maya, agentty) point the same banlist at their own sources and so need the
# same rot check on their own allowlists. It was written in agentty first;
# keeping a copy per consumer is how the two would drift apart.
#
# Two kinds of rot, both invisible to the banlist itself (it walks the files
# on disk and only ever LOOKS UP the allowlist, so a stale grant is silently
# ignored rather than reported):
#
#   dead   — the entry names a file that no longer exists.
#   stale  — the file exists but no longer uses a primitive it is allowed.
#
# Either way the effect is the same: a hand-checked exemption outliving the
# code that justified it, so the next person to add a std::mutex there
# inherits a pass nobody granted them.
#
